** templates must be added and run in the order that satisfies dependency order best. (also consider pairings if possible)
i.e. a drone can only run after it's dependants have had their turn (unless they mutually depend)

** param 'default' values... (when accessing param, if nil, return default (unless default is nil too))

** move application.js.coffee onreadies into init.js.coffee and require it
